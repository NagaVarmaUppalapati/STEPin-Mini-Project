## Introduction
 - As a result of pandemic, online voting system became the euphoria across several countries. After all, it seemed like a logical next step for the internet and it makes elections more convenient, accessible and cheaper. This project seeks to solve a few problems associated with the traditional in-person voting system by creating an online voting system in which the users do not have to go to the polling booth to cast their votes, instead users can cast thier votes from any desktop/laptop with Internet access.

## BENEFITS
  1. Vote at any time from anywhere
   - The online election system increases accessibility for residents abroad and for persons with difficulties in travelling as they can easily cast their votes from any computer system which has internet accessibility.
  2. Boost participation
   - The online election system tends to maximize user participation, by allowing them to vote from anywhere and allowing access from different computer systems and from any device that has an internet connection.
  3. Fast and easy votes tally
   - Since the tally in online election is run by machines, it is almost certain that it will not have human counting errors and that it will in most cases run faster than a count carried out by persons, so the results of the election will be available faster.
  4. Increases efficiency
   - The reduction in organizational and implementation costs significantly increases the efficiency of election management compared to traditional paper election.

## Cost and Features and Timeline
- This was a costless application and we have features like 1.For voting 2.Add candidates 3.List of voters 4.List of Candidates 5.Live count  6.Exit 

## Defining Our System
- This application can store all votes. It can store all the candidate details, such as their names and it can store all voters ids and their details also.
