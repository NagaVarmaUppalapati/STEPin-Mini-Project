# Introduction
- As a result of pandemic, online voting system became the euphoria across several countries. After all, it seemed like a logical next step for the internet and it makes elections more convenient, accessible and cheaper. This project seeks to solve a few problems associated with the traditional in-person voting system by creating an online voting system in which the users do not have to go to the polling booth to cast their votes, instead users can cast thier votes from any desktop/laptop with Internet access.
